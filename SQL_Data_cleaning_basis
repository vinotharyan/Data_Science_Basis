## Data Cleaning in Sql

##LEFT 
pulls a specified number of characters for each row in a specified column starting at the beginning (or from the left). 
As you saw here, you can pull the first three digits of a phone number using LEFT(phone_number, 3).

## RIGHT 
pulls a specified number of characters for each row in a specified column starting at the end (or from the right). 
As you saw here, you can pull the last eight digits of a phone number using RIGHT(phone_number, 8).

## LENGTH
this provides the number of characters for each row of a specified column. 
Here, you saw that we could use this to get the length of each phone number as LENGTH(phone_number).

There are 350 company names that start with a letter and 1 that starts with a number. 
This gives a ratio of 350/351 that are company names that start with a letter or 99.7%.

SELECT SUM(num) nums, SUM(letter) letters
FROM (SELECT name, CASE WHEN LEFT(UPPER(name), 1) IN ('0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9') 
                       THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS num, 
         CASE WHEN LEFT(UPPER(name), 1) IN ('0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9') 
                       THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS letter
      FROM accounts) t1;

There are 80 company names that start with a vowel and 271 that start with other characters. 
Therefore 80/351 are vowels or 22.8%. Therefore, 77.2% of company names do not start with vowels.

SELECT SUM(vowels) vowels, SUM(other) other
FROM (SELECT name, CASE WHEN LEFT(UPPER(name), 1) IN ('A','E','I','O','U') 
                        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS vowels, 
          CASE WHEN LEFT(UPPER(name), 1) IN ('A','E','I','O','U') 
                       THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS other
         FROM accounts) t1;

## POSITION 
takes a character and a column, and provides the index where that character is for each row. 
The index of the first position is 1 in SQL. If you come from another programming language, 
many begin indexing at 0. Here, you saw that you can pull the index of a comma as POSITION(',' IN city_state).

## STRPOS 
provides the same result as POSITION, but the syntax for achieving those results is a bit different as shown here: 
STRPOS(city_state, ',').
note, both POSITION and STRPOS are case sensitive, so looking for A is different than looking for a. 

Therefore, if you want to pull an index regardless of the case of a letter, 
you might want to use LOWER or UPPER to make all of the characters lower or uppercase.

1.	Use the accounts table to create first and last name columns that hold the first and last names for the primary_poc. 
 
 SELECT LEFT(primary_poc, STRPOS(primary_poc, ' ') -1 ) first_name, 
RIGHT(primary_poc, LENGTH(primary_poc) - STRPOS(primary_poc, ' ')) last_name
FROM accounts;


2.	Now see if you can do the same thing for every rep name in the sales_reps table. Again provide first and last name columns.


## CONCAT

## Piping ||
Each of these will allow you to combine columns together across rows. , 
you saw how first and last names stored in separate columns could be combined together to create a full name: 

CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) or with piping as first_name || ' ' || last_name.

1.	Each company in the accounts table wants to create an email address for each primary_poc. 
The email address should be the first name of the primary_poc . last name primary_poc @ company name .com.

  WITH t1 AS (
 SELECT LEFT(primary_poc,     STRPOS(primary_poc, ' ') -1 ) first_name,  
 RIGHT(primary_poc, LENGTH(primary_poc) - STRPOS(primary_poc, ' ')) last_name, name
 FROM accounts)
SELECT first_name, last_name, CONCAT(first_name, '.', last_name, '@', name, '.com')
FROM t1;



2.	You may have noticed that in the previous solution some of the company names include spaces, 
which will certainly not work in an email address. See if you can create an email address that will work by 
removing all of the spaces in the account name,
but otherwise your solution should be just as in question 1. Some helpful documentation is here.

WITH t1 AS (
 SELECT LEFT(primary_poc,     STRPOS(primary_poc, ' ') -1 ) first_name,  
 RIGHT(primary_poc, LENGTH(primary_poc) - STRPOS(primary_poc, ' ')) last_name, name
 FROM accounts)
SELECT first_name, last_name, CONCAT(first_name, '.', last_name, '@', REPLACE(name, ' ', ''), '.com')
FROM  t1;



## TO_DATE
3# CAST
### Casting with ::


DATE_PART('month', TO_DATE(month, 'month')) here changed a month name into the number associated with that particular month.

Then you can change a string to a date using CAST. CAST is actually useful to change lots of column types.
Commonly you might be doing as you saw here, where you change a string to a date using CAST(date_column AS DATE). 
However, you might want to make other changes to your columns in terms of their data types. You can see other examples here.
In this example, you also saw that instead of CAST(date_column AS DATE), you can use date_column::DATE.
Expert Tip
Most of the functions presented in this lesson are specific to strings. They won’t work with dates, integers or floating-point numbers.
However, using any of these functions will automatically change the data to the appropriate type.
LEFT, RIGHT, and TRIM are all used to select only certain elements of strings, 
but using them to select elements of a number or date will treat them as strings for the purpose of the function. 
Though we didn't cover TRIM in this lesson explicitly, it can be used to remove characters from the beginning and end of a string. 
This can remove unwanted spaces at the beginning or end of a row that often happen with data being moved from Excel or 
other storage systems.There are a number of variations of these functions,
as well as several other string functions not covered here. Different databases use subtle variations on these functions,
so be sure to look up the appropriate database’s syntax if you’re connected to a private database.
The Postgres literature contains a lot of the related functions.

Notice, this new date can be operated on using DATE_TRUNC and DATE_PART in the same way as earlier lessons.

SELECT date orig_date, (SUBSTR(date, 7, 4) || '-' || LEFT(date, 2) || '-' || SUBSTR(date, 4, 2))::DATE new_date
FROM sf_crime_data;

In general, COALESCE returns the first non-NULL value passed for each row. 

SELECT COALESCE(a.id, a.id) filled_id, a.name, a.website, a.lat, a.long, a.primary_poc, a.sales_rep_id, o.*
FROM accounts a
LEFT JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
WHERE o.total IS NULL
